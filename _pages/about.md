My name is Woo Chang Kang and I am an associate professor in the Department of Politics and International Relations at Korea University. I received my Ph.D. from New York University in 2015. Before joining Korea University, I worked as a postdoc at Yale University in 2015 and lecturer at the Australian National University, 2016 â€“ 2019. 

My research interests are in political behavior and quantitative political analysis, with particular attention to Korea and the United States.
