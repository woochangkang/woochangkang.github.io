Welcome! My name is Woo Chang Kang and I am an associate professor in the Department of Politics and International Relations at Korea University. I received my Ph.D. from New York University in 2015. Before joining Korea University in 2019, I worked as a postdoc at Yale University and a lecturer at the Australian National University.
